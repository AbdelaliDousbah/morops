Linux is a Unix-like operating system that was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. Since then, it has gone through many significant developments and has become one of the most widely used operating systems in the world. Here are a few notable milestones in the development of the Linux operating system:

1. 1991: Linus Torvalds releases the first version of the Linux kernel.
2. 1993: The first version of the X Window System (X11) is released, which enables the use of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.

3. 1994: The first version of the Linux Standard Base (LSB) is released, which aims to standardize the APIs and ABIs of Linux distributions.

4. 1996: The first version of the GNOME desktop environment is released, which becomes one of the most popular desktop environments for Linux.

5. 1997: The first version of the Debian distribution is released, which becomes one of the most popular and influential Linux distributions.

6. 2002: The first version of the KDE Plasma desktop environment is released, which also becomes a popular choice for Linux users.

7. 2006: The Linux kernel is included in the top 10 of the TIOBE Index, which measures the popularity of programming languages.

8. 2010: The Android operating system, based on the Linux kernel, becomes the best-selling smartphone operating system in the world.

9. 2012: The Linux Mint distribution becomes the most popular distribution according to the page hit rankings at DistroWatch.

10. 2013: The Linux kernel reaches 3.11, which brings significant improvements to the kernel’s scalability, power management, and support for newer hardware.

11. 2014: Steam, a popular digital distribution platform for video games, announces support for Linux.

12. 2015: The release of the Unity 8 desktop environment marks a shift towards convergence, which aims to make it possible to use the same codebase for both desktop and mobile devices.

13. 2016: The release of the Snap package format makes it easier for developers to distribute their applications on multiple Linux distributions.

14. 2017: The release of the Wayland display server, which aims to replace the X Window System, brings significant improvements to the performance and security of Linux on the desktop.

15. 2019: The release of the Pinebook Pro laptop, which is powered by the Linux-based Manjaro operating system, brings attention to the growing market for affordable, Linux-powered laptops.

16. 2020: The Linux kernel reaches version 5.7, which includes support for the WireGuard virtual private network (VPN) protocol and brings significant performance improvements to the kernel’s memory management.

17. 2021: The release of the PinePhone, a smartphone that runs the Linux-based postmarketOS operating system, brings attention to the potential for Linux on mobile devices.

18. 2022: Linux runs all top 500 supercomputers, billions of personal devices, most servers on the Internet, on all continents, on all oceans, in the air, in orbit, and on Mars. Oh, and in the air on Mars. All big corporations use open source in some form.

It’s understandable that some people might be frustrated with the progress of Linux on the desktop. While Linux has made significant strides in recent years and is used by many people as their daily driver, it still has a ways to go before it is as user-friendly and widely adopted as some other operating systems.

That being said, it’s important to remember that Linux is a volunteer-driven project and that its developers are constantly working to improve the operating system. Additionally, it’s worth considering that the “year of the Linux desktop” has been prophesied many times in the past, and yet, it has yet to come to fruition. This is not to say that it never will, but rather that it’s important to be realistic about the current state of Linux on the desktop and the challenges it still faces.

Ultimately, whether or not Linux becomes the dominant desktop operating system is not up to any one person or group. It will depend on the efforts of the Linux community, the demand for it from users, and the support it receives from hardware and software vendors. In the meantime, it’s important to support and appreciate the work of the Linux developers and community and to continue to advocate for its use where it makes sense.

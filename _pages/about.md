<p>While there are a number of other Linux websites on the internet, MOROPS focuses specifically on Linux novices. Its mission statement is to enhance your desktop Linux experience. It's Free and Open Source aims to increase the number of Linux desktop users by assisting them in resolving a variety of issues. With screenshots and clear instructions, beginners are in mind when writing tutorials.</p>

<p>Let me tell you one thing if you're wondering how It's MOROPS differs from other blogs in the same field. We put all of the tutorials, tips, and tricks through their paces first. We will not propose you to take a stab at anything which we haven't attempted ourselves.
</p>

<p>MOROPS offers information on a variety of applications that can enhance the Linux desktop experience in addition to how-to tutorials. In order to keep readers informed, we also cover Open Source-related news.
